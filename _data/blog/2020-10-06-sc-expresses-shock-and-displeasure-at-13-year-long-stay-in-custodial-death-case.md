The accused police officer had challenged the summons issued by the trial court before the Allahabad High Court. While issuing notice in the matter, the High Court had also granted an interim stay on September 13, 2007. The matter continued in that position since then for the last 13 years with the criminal proceedings stayed.

SC noted that at one stage, the High Court had even reserved its orders on the proceedings on February 14, 2013, but had again listed the matter for rehearing on March 6, 2013, which again did not produce any result.

In 2018, the son of the deceased approached the Supreme Court against the criminal proceedings being put in abeyance by way of the High Court’s interim order.

A division bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Aniruddha Bose and Krishna Murari on September 23, 2020, while vacating the interim order of the High Court expressed its displeasure at staying the Trial Court’s order summoning the accused police officer for 13 years.
